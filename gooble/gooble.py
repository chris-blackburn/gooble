# 1. Each guild is considered to be a house (or game)
#   - Houses can be reset (all bets and monies are cleared)
#     * We can also add some base payout so people who hit zero aren't dead in
#       the water
#   - Players are provided a balance the first time they place a bet (or request
#     a summary of their funds)
#     * Maybe we can use a decorator on all functions to do this?
# 2. In a house, players can start new bets and place their wagers
#   - A bet will have a win criteria
#   - All bets are zero-sum (the total loses equal total winnings)
#   - Players can place stakes and wagers on a bet (the amount they are gambling
#     on a particular outcome)
# 3. Payouts close bets and distribute the winnings
